/* BLOCK SETTING METHODS */

// The point of these methods is basically to abstract out whether we're using blockStartedDate (the old system)
// or blockEndDate (the new system) for tracking blocks in settings/lockfile. We want to be backwards-compatible for a while so people
// who upgrade mid-block (foolishly!) have a better chance of surviving and we don't bork their stuff.
// eventually, another way to do this would just be to convert all blockStartedDates to blockEndDates on launch,
// but that sounds risky (updating lock files is not guaranteed) and this seems safer for now...
