Branch [`use-true-time`](https://github.com/shaandsingh/selfcontrol/tree/use-true-time), off [working copy](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/commit/2c9f30b46eccc1d3ebf1d6284da7a971da1c81f9), attempts to make SelfControl impervious to the only easy trick to disabling it—changing the date/time in System Preferences past the timer's expiry. [Original issue](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/issues/28), [solution idea](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/issues/475), [development thread](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/issues/618).

ABOUT
-----
SelfControl is a free and open-source application for macOS that lets you block <strong>your own</strong> access to distracting websites, your mail servers, or anything else on the Internet. Just set a period of time to block for, add sites to your blacklist, and click "Start."  Until that timer expires, you will be unable to access those sites—even if you restart your computer or delete the application.
